# Prediction-of-rainfall-australia
Prediction of tomorrow's rainfall based on several factors such as today's rainfall &amp; weather conditions

 - The main objective of this project is to predictive the Australia's Tomorrow's rainfall based on 23 features.
   - This dataset contains daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations.
   - The target variable RainTomorrow means: Did it rain the next day? Yes or No.
   
   Used hard voting, soft voting,KNN,logistic,decision trees,Linear SVM,PCA,Neural networks.
   
   Also used methods to improve accuracy such as bagging,pasting,boosting,CV grid search & implemented all models with best parameters.
